# Redmond Fire & Rescue Cookbook

The Redmond Fire & Rescue (RFR) cookbook is a mobile app that lists and displays RFR's field protocols as PDFs. Individuals who have access to the admin panel can add and remove files. 

## Deployment

When you are ready to distribute a new version of the application, your first step
is to bump the build number, or version number and build number, in _pubspec.yml_.

TODO

### Android / Google Play Store

TODO

### iOS / Apple App Store

Build a new "app archive" with `flutter build ipa`.
